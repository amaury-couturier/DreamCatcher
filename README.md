# DreamCatcher
My 3D game for Adv. Game Design and Development

All controls are shown in the "Options" button of the main menu. What I forgot to include is that by pressing Shift or Left Control when wall running, you are able to move up or down on the wall.

The music and 3D Models were made by myself. The programming was also done by myself but, for the most part, I followed tutorials so I don't want to take credit. The sound effects are from Pixabay.
